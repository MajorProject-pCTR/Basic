i/p : o/p of unrolled and o/p of non-unrolled
	train on unrolled, valid on non-unrolled, test on non-unrolled

so features -> unrolled and non-unrolled o/p on train, non-unrolled on valid, non-unrolled on test

non-unrolled file format : click, impr, {lin_reg, log_reg, nn}(non-unrolled o/p)
unrolled file format : if_click, {lin_reg, log_reg, nn}(unrolled o/p)

o/p : o/p for (o/p of non-unrolled)

to check AUC : csv :
i/p : click,impr,lin_reg,log_reg,nn
o/p : CTR for non-unrolled
